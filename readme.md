# Koala Holla

Our client, Koala Holla (1976 Llama Comma Drive, Walla Walla WA) is a non-profit dedicated to the ethical transitioning of koalas from the outdoors (whereupon they may be rained) to urban areas where roofs exist. Your team has been hired build a web app to handle their terrarium residents. Koala Holla has provided a TSV (tab separated values) spreadsheet of their current inventory. They want a database table that houses this information and can be viewed at any time. After importing the data, create a web app to display the Koalas. Users should be able to add new Koalas to the database through the provided HTML form.
